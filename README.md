# First Code Challenge: JS and jQuery
Quick Reminder: This Code Challenge doesn't assess your worth as a human being. You're great! Deep breath. Have fun.

Follow the steps below to complete the code challenge. To ensure our tests work, be sure to use the class names as described and the provided starting code.

## Base Mode

1. Create a `<button>` element on the DOM, you may do this in jQuery, or write it directly in the HTML code. Have the button text read "Generate". 

2. Using jQuery, append a `<div>` element when you click the button.

3. Inside the `<div>` element you created in the previous step, create a `<p>` element that shows how many times you have clicked the button from the first step.

4. Inside the `<div>` element you created in step two, append two `<button>` elements. The text of the two buttons should read "Swap" and "Delete". 

5. In a CSS file, any `<div>` created using the "Generate" button should have a Red background-color.

6. Clicking a "Delete" `<button>` should remove its parent `<div>` container (and all of its contents). 

## Hard Mode

1. Clicking a "Swap" `<button>` should change its parent background-color from Red to Yellow.

2. Clicking a "Swap" `<button>` again should change its parent background-color from Yellow back to Red.

No need to do anything beyond the challenge described above. Once you are complete, check your code into a GitHub repo and submit via this application.

## Cool Down Mode - When you're done with hard mode

Ok, it's been a pretty crazy week. This stuff is hard. Take some time to review all of the things we've covered in such a short time. This is not a part of your challenge, and you do not need to submit this. Just use it for some review:
