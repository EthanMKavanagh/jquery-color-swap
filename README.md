# First Code Challenge

Follow the steps below to complete the code challenge. So our tests work, be sure to use the class names as described and the provided starting code:

1. Create a `<button>` element on the DOM, you may do this in jQuery, or write it directly in the HTML code. Give the button the class `create`.

2. Using jQuery, when the button is clicked append a `<div>` element to the provided `container` div. The new div should have the class `color-div`.

3. Inside the `<div>` element you created in the previous step, create a `<p>` element that shows how many times you have clicked the button from the first step.

4. Inside the `<div>` element you created in step two, append two `<button>` elements. The buttons should have a class of `swap` and `delete`.

5. In a CSS file, any `<div>` created using the `create` button should have a Red background-color.

6. Clicking a `swap` `<button>` should change its parent background-color from Red to Yellow.

7. Clicking a `delete` `<button>` should remove its parent `<div>` container (and all of its contents).

No need to do anything beyond the challenge described above. Once you are complete, check your code into a GitHub repo and submit via this application. Then quietly leave the room until the challenge is over.
