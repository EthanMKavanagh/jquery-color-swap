# First Code Challenge: JS and jQuery

Follow the steps below to complete the code challenge. To ensure our tests work, be sure to use the class names as described and the provided starting code.

Take a deep breath. You can do this. This is open book. You can use your notes or past assignments. Break it up into small steps and accomplish as much as you can.

1. Fork and clone the repo to get the starting code for this project. 

2. Using jQuery, when the create button is clicked append a `<div>` element to the provided `container` div. The new div should have the class `color-div`.

3. Inside the `<div>` element you created in the previous step, create a `<p>` element that shows how many times you have clicked the button from the first step.

4. Inside the `<div>` element you created in step two, append two `<button>` elements. One button should have a class of `swap` and one button should have a class of `delete`.

5. In a CSS file, any `<div>` created using the `create` button should have a red background-color.

6. Clicking a `swap` `<button>` should change its parent background-color from red to yellow.

7. Clicking a `delete` `<button>` should remove its parent `<div>` container (and all of its contents).

No need to do anything beyond the challenge described above. Once you are complete, check your code into a GitHub repo and submit the repo link via the assignment application. You are welcome to leave the room once you are finished or stay at your desk. Either way, please be respectful of people who are still working.
